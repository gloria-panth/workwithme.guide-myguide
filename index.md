## Values
- I value people's right to pursue happiness as long as it doesn't leave a negative impact on others.
- I value finding humor in the little things to keep life light and fun.

## Personality

I'm a go-with-the-flow/easy-going type of personality. I enjoy a good challenge to get the blood flowing to my head.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?

Positive:
- I don't really have a preferance for positive feedback. I think any recognition is nice :) 

Negative:
- I prefer to have a 1-on-1 to address the negative feedback to dig into the issue. It's okay to be blunt with me.


## Work Patterns

What hours do you usually work?
- I usually work from 9 - 5:30 ish every day. 
- I ideally would like to have my 1-on-1 meetings in the afternoons and group meetings in the morning.

When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups?
- I prefer to try to work out issues by myself first rather than asking questions immediatly.
- When I find myself stuck or lost on a topic, I would like to work with others to iron it out.

How do your energy levels fluctuate through-out the day?
- My energy levels are high roughly at 10 AM and 1 PM.
- I find that my enegery level is usually lower in the morning and near lunch time (probably because I'm hungry!)

## Communication Preferences
- I prefer to be reached by slack messages, because I like to reread and have references.
- I like to have face-to-face in person if it's a long topic or a zoom call if that's not possible.

## How To Know Iâ€™ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs
- I get more reserved and quiet to the point of being reclusive.

### How to help
- I feel more at ease when:
  - I have more context and understanding of the topic to give input.
  - With familiar individuals.

## Me Being Me

- Sometimes I look up in silence (and maybe squinting) when I'm trying to process information. I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just focusing really hard on what you just said.


## Areas for Development

- Asking enough questions. I get afraid of asking too many questions. Sometimes I don't know where to begin asking questions if I dont have even context in the topic.
- Breaking out of flow. When I'm in flow, I get tunnel vision until I hit a roadblock or until the task is done. 


## Ask Me About

- Food
- Traveling
- League of Legends
